# Daniel's Take On .....

## Purpose Statement

After **much** work, my [documentation site](https://docs.bydanielrosehill.com) is a "thing" and contains a somewhat organised gathering of all the random markdown notes that I've uploaded to Github over the past couple of years.

Because I sometimes like thinking about stuff besides computers, I thought I'd add a repo to jot down some general musings about life too.

Not that anyone asked, but if you ever wanted to get my hot takes on `X`, use the menu to the left to browse by category!
